# FinTech-Case-Study-Ledn
## Name of company

Ledn

* When was the company incorporated?

Ledn was founded in 2018, and it is based in Toronto, Ontario(1)

* Who are the founders of the company?

The two founders of Ledn are:
- Adam Reeds, Co-founder & CEO
- Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, Co-founder & Chief Strategy Officer(1)

* How did the idea for the company come about?

Ledn is a Toronto-based company committed to "building world class financial services catered to the crypto economy”(1). The company offers a suite of products to help their clients get the most out of their digital assets by offering higher yields than the traditional bank accounts or credit products that give access to dollars while keeping their Bitcoin assets, and minimizing tax implications.
The idea of a Bitcoin-backed mortgage (currently in Pilot) came from their clients, who were using their existing bitcoin-backed loans, they were crypto investors with large amounts of Bitcoin holdings and were interested in leverage it without having to sell their Bitcoin.(2)
	
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Ledn raised 36 Million CAD in May 2021, and most recently the company raised an additional $90 Million CAD ($70 Million USD) in December 2021 to help support its new Bitcoin-backed mortgage product.(3) Some of the most prominent investors include 10T Holdings, Golden Tree Asset Management, Raptor Group, FJ Labs, Whitestar Capital, Kingsway Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Alan Howard, among others. 
One of Ledn’s main partners include Genesis Capital, which is one of the world’s largest digital asset lenders and borrowers allowing Ledn to generate yields by lending digital currencies like BTC and USDC in large quantities.(1)(4)
Ledn claims the company was valued at $ 696 Million CAD equivalent to $540 Million USD by the end of 2021. 

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Today people with significant wealth in Bitcoin cannot utilize their assets to qualify for a mortgage or a loan at a bank. Ledn offers clients the possibility to diversify their portfolio to protect their wealth via crypto assets, and then utilize those assets to purchase a home, or get a loan.  
Ledn offers a suite of products including:
- Saving products in USCD and BTC: Clients can get up to 9.25% in annual interest.
- Lending products: Lend offers ‘B2X loans’ in which clients deposit an amount of BTC and Ledn matches it through a loan at an 8.9% interest. (Plus 2% fees for a total 10.9% APR) The interest expenses for the loan may be tax deductible.
- Bitcoin-backed USD loans: Ledn offers a 50% Loan-to-Value loan with 8.9% interest rate (10.9% APR). This product helps clients access dollars without having to sell a Bitcoin position, avoiding taxable events, and the interest expenses for the loan may be tax deductible as well. The loan can be paid back and the Bitcoin can be withdrawn at any time without penalties.
- Bitcoin-backed Mortgages: Ledn is piloting Bitcoin-backed mortgages to clients who don’t want to sell their Bitcoin holdings. This new collateral structure relies on the stability of real estate to buffer against the volatility of Bitcoin. Clients can get up to 50% the value of the collateral (50% LTV). Term is up to 2 years, and it can be re-assessed at the end of the term. The interest rate of the mortgage is not specified, but Ledn claims it is lower than the regular loans they offer. 
- Trading: Ledn offers trading services between BTC and USDC with no fees. 

* Who is the company’s intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Ledn is primarily focused on crypto-friendly investors who are interested in maximizing their digital assets through bitcoin-backed mortgages, loans, and/or earning interest through their digital (Bitcoin, and USDC) assets. 

Based on a recent online poll conducted by Ipsos on Bitcoin usage and attitudes in Canada, it is estimated that 14% of Canadians owned some type of cryptocurrency in 2021 equivalent to 4.2 million Canadians, which is a significant increase compared to 2016 when only 3% indicated they owned some form of cryptocurrency.(5) One in four adults is considering buying in the future mainly as a micro-investment, which gives this market a lot of growth potential in the future.(5) Another similar study conducted by Finder also estimated that 14% of Canadian adults own some form of cryptocurrency and approximately a third of them (34%) own Bitcoin, making it the most popular cryptocurrency.(6) 

Savings and Lending: If we define the market size as the number of Bitcoin owners in Canada then we could estimate that approximately 1.4 million people represent the market size for the Savings and Lending products. 

Mortgages: The new bitcoin-mortgage product may have a more limited market size since only clients with a significant amount of Bitcoin may be eligible. We could define the market size of the mortgage product as the number of wallets with at least one BTC in the USA and Canada, where the product is currently available. There are approximately 106 million of crypto owners in the world, and 200 million of crypto wallets(7); as of November 2021, 818,923 addresses had at least one BTC.(7) If we assume that ~30% of Bitcoin holders are in the US and Canada (~30% of Bitcoin traders are in the US and Canada based on a 2019 report by CH&Co(8)), then the market size of addresses with at least one BTC in Canada and the US is approximately 245,400 BTC addresses. It is important to highlight that one person can have multiple addresses, therefore the number of people would likely be lower.

The company plans to focus on the English, Portuguese and Spanish-language users.
Ledn claims they have a growing waitlist for the mortgage product which will be available in Canada and the United States in early 2022. The company is targeting over $100 million in Bitcoin-backed mortgages by the end of Q1-2022.(3)
Ledn's existing client base is located in 127 countries, with 44% of their client base in Latin America.(3)

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

One differentiation is that Ledn is about to offer the first Bitcoin-backed mortgage in Canada. They are also supported by Genesis Capital, which is the one of the world’s largest digital asset lender and borrower allowing Ledn to generate yields by lending digital currencies like BTC and USDC in large quantities. Genesis only works with a very limited number of partners, so this partnership contributes to Ledn’s credibility in the marketplace and gives the company flexibility to offer no deposit limits. Ledn is also the only digital asset lending company to have “Proof of reserves” attestation by an independent top-25 third party public accountant. This gives clients piece of mind that their Bitcoin and USDC are being accurately accounted for at all times.(1)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

Ledn uses a mobile app for iOS and Android, and they use a website to onboard clients where they verify KYC (Know your customer) and AML (Anti-Money laundering). Ledn does not run credit checks. Based on their website, software is provided by Ledn.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Lending, and Savings.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

This is a relatively new space, over the years there has been an explosive growth in the use of cryptocurrencies. Some digital assets have appreciated significantly over the last few years, which has contributed to the creation and introduction of new offerings designed to help investors leverage their existing crypto assets to get additional yield without the need to sell their portfolio while minimizing tax implications.
These new products include new saving vehicles where clients can get a better yield than in traditional saving accounts in a bank, or lending products to access loans using crypto assets as collateral. 
In the last few years Decentralized Finance, also known as DeFi, emerged offering new financial applications built on blockchain technology to enable clients lend, stake, and invest in crypto without the need for an intermediary. 
The Real Estate industry has started to adopt Bitcoin as a payment method for home purchases, (i.g., BTC home/Real Estate Bay realty). It may be just a matter of time before we start to see more adoption in Canada.


* What are the other major companies in this domain?

- Unchained Capital (Austin, Tx): Offers Bitcoin-backed mortgages for home purchases or rent payments, limiting tax liability and maintaining long positions in crypto.(10)
- Matrix Mortgage Global (Toronto, ON): Accepts Bitcoin, Ethereum and some stable coins as deposit or downpayment for the purchase of a home. (11)
- BlockFi: Based in New Jersey, the company offers saving accounts using various cryptocurrencies (including ETH, BTC, SOL, among others.), and also Bitcoin-backed loans with up to 50% LTV, and rates as low as 4.5%.(12)


## Results:

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Current assets on the Ledn platform exceed $1.7 billion USD, which represents a 4,000% growth YoY. (9) 
The company has been featured in the CBC, CNN, Cryptonews, Coindesk, Bitcoin Magazine, among other media outlets.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? 

Ledn is targeting over $100 Million USD in Bitcoin backed mortgage originations by the end of Q1-2022. 
Some of the metrics used to assess performance in the industry include (but are not limited to): Assets under management (AUM), number of clients, revenue size or total volume of originations. 

* How is your company performing?

Current assets on the Ledn platform exceed $1.7 billion USD, which represents a 4,000% growth YoY. (9)

* How is your company relative to competitors in the same domain?

Ledn is offering the first Bitcoin-backed mortgage in Canada. 
For non-mortgage loans Ledn charges slightly higher interest rates than other competitors (ie. BlockFi, Crypto .com) 
Ledn Saving accounts offer a very competitive interest rate to clients making it a very good option for Bitcoin and USDC saving accounts; however, Ledn does not offer other cryptocurrency (non-BTC/USDC) at the moment like BlockFi does.

## Recommendations:

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

Product:
Depending on the initial results of the new Bitcoin-backed mortgage product pilot, Ledn could explore introducing new offerings using Ethereum-backed mortgages, as well as offering a yield for Savings accounts denominated in ETH. Ledn could also explore creating new hybrid products with both BTC and ETH.
Ledn could add more flexibility to the Bitcoin-backed mortgage product to help their clients, for example having access to longer terms (beyond 2 years), and longer amortization periods. 
Ledn could consider developing Ethereum-backed loans to help clients leverage their holdings denominated in Ethereum. 

Client acquisition:
Ledn currently has a referral program I which the referrer (client) and the referee may receive $10USDC when the new client opens an account, as long as they meet the Terms and conditions. I would suggest they explore testing different incentive structures, and potentially develop additional programs to try to increase their presence among Centres of Influence in the ecosystem (COIs).
Ledn could explore expanding their partnerships within the Home ecosystem including brokerages, real estate agents, among others.
Incentives could also be presented to clients in the form of Bitcoin or other Cryptocurrency should they decide to get a mortgage, saving accounts or loans.

Communications: 
Given the recent events in Canada associated with the temporary freezing of financial assets by the government, I would review the content of the website and other communication materials to highlight the value proposition of Bitcoin, the safety measures that Ledn is implementing, and provide piece of mind to clients who may hesitate to use these products, as well as mitigating the negative perception around the lack of insurance coverage by FDIC. One example could be highlighting the fact that Ledn is the only digital asset lending company to have “Proof of reserves” attestation by an independent top-25 third party public accountant.
Ledn is the first company offering a Bitcoin-backed mortgage in Canada, so I recommend developing thought leadership materials to the industry sharing some of their learnings in the space, as this could help position Ledn as a leader in the space.

Client experience and research:
Ledn could explore conducting additional client research, understand the painpoints of clients when purchasing a home or getting a loan, map out the client journey with the corresponding pinpoints and uncover potential areas of opportunity to add value beyond the Bitcoin-backed mortgage,  or loans/saving accounts. There may be additional use cases that could be attractive to clients. 
Ledn could explore the introduction of Gamification to the mortgage experience, for example delivering a small token of appreciation to clients when the pay off their mortgage or loan.


* What Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

New extended mortgage terms beyond two years would give clients more flexibility in their finances, and perhaps some clients may even consider more than one mortgage.
Ethereum (and or hybrid models with BTC and ETH) backed loans and mortgages would allow Ledn to have access to a wider number of people, and would give clients more flexibility around how to use their crypto assets without the need to convert their ETH into BTC, while minimizing tax implications.
enhanced offers, marketing, referral programs and incentives would help Ledn increase their ability to attract new customers, improve awareness among the general public, and players in the ecosystems (ie. Realtors) who could serve as new sales channels to increase their pipeline of new clients. 
Partnerships could also be a powerful tactic to increase the value of their products while building on its brand equity. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

My recommendations would use the same existing technology that Ledn uses today. (Note: It was not possible to validate the actual technologies and processes that the company uses; the recommendations in this document are based on the information available online) in  Ledn would need to continue developing clear fulfillment processes, control measures as well as rigid cost management practices for the offer incentives. Perhaps there could be some coding developed to auto-determine what clients are eligible for the offers based on the Terms & Conditions. (If-then statements or Smart contracts)
In terms of the referral programs Ledn already has one program in place, any new configuration would be an adjustment to their existing system and they could leverage the same capabilities depending on the volume. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

The recommendations provided are for the most part “low-hanging fruits” and do not require significant new technologies and investments. If implemented successfully the recommendations could have a significant impact on client engagement, satisfaction and market penetration.
